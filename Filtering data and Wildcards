Understanding Wildcards in SQL
During the class, it was explained that underscores and percentages have special meanings when using SQL's LIKE operator:

Underscore _: Represents a single character.
Percentage %: Represents zero or more characters.
For example:

SELECT * FROM table WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
This would select all rows where the name starts with 'A' and is followed by any number of characters .

SQL Queries with Conditional Operators
We explored using SQL conditional operators such as =, <>, AND, OR, and NOT to filter the database results:

AND: All conditions separated by AND must be TRUE.
OR: Any of the conditions separated by OR can be TRUE.
NOT: Reverses the value of a boolean expression.
Example: Filtering with Conditions
SELECT * FROM products WHERE (product_id > 3 AND product_id < 8) OR product_id = 10;
This query fetches products with IDs between 4 and 7 and products with an ID of 10【4:10†typed.md】.

Manipulating Strings in SQL
Several examples demonstrated string concatenation and manipulation:

Using CONCAT() to combine strings.
Utilizing UPPER() and LOWER() to change text cases.
Employing SUBSTR() to fetch parts of a string.
Example: String Concatenation
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name FROM customers;
This creates a new column full_name by concatenating the first and last names separated by a space .

Example: Capitalizing Names
The instructor showed how to capitalize the first character of names:

SELECT UPPER(SUBSTR(first_name, 1, 1)) || SUBSTR(first_name, 2) AS capitalized FROM customers;
This changes the first letter to uppercase while leaving the rest in lowercase .

SQL Execution Order
The class emphasized understanding the order of execution in SQL, important for writing effective queries:

FROM clause
WHERE clause
GROUP BY clause
HAVING clause
SELECT clause
ORDER BY clause
Understanding this sequence helps in optimized and error-free query writing .

Using BETWEEN for Date Ranges
To find data within a date range, the BETWEEN keyword was used:

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
This retrieves orders within the entire year of 2023, highlighting that BETWEEN is inclusive【4:10†typed.md】.

Handling NULLs and Default Values
The class addressed handling NULLs, shown through:

COALESCE() or IFNULL() functions, which substitute NULLs with a default value.
Assigning default values to certain fields when necessary:
SELECT product_id, COALESCE(size, 'medium') FROM products;
This assigns 'medium' to any product sizes that are NULL .
