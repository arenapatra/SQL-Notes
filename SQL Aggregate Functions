COUNT Function Variations
COUNT(*) vs COUNT(1) vs COUNT(col_name) vs COUNT(DISTINCT col_name):
COUNT(*): Counts all rows, including NULL values.
COUNT(1): Similar to COUNT(*), often used for the same purpose, counting all rows.
COUNT(col_name): Counts the number of non-NULL entries in a specified column.
COUNT(DISTINCT col_name): Counts distinct non-NULL entries, ideal for identifying unique values .
GROUP BY Clause
The GROUP BY statement aggregates data across multiple records by specifying the level of summarization.

Syntax:
SELECT [columns to return]
FROM [table]
WHERE [conditional filter statements]
GROUP BY [columns to group on]
ORDER BY [columns to sort on]
LIMIT [first x number of rows to be selected];

Execution Order: FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, Aggregate functions, SELECT, ORDER BY, OFFSET, LIMIT .
Practical SQL Queries and Examples
Analyzing Patient Data

Basic COUNT Example:

Calculate the total number of patient records:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Patients FROM med.hospital;
This counts all records in the hospital table .

Unique Medical Conditions:

Find the number of unique medical conditions:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Medical_Condition) AS Unique_Conditions FROM med.hospital;
Percentage of Patients Diagnosed with Each Condition:

Determine the spread of medical conditions amongst patients:
SELECT 
    Medical_Condition,
    CONCAT(ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM med.hospital), 2), "%") AS Percentage_Patients
FROM med.hospital
GROUP BY Medical_Condition
ORDER BY Percentage_Patients DESC;
This query calculates what percentage of patients are diagnosed with each condition .

Distribution of Patients' Age:

Use GROUP BY on the Age column to get the count of patients per age group:
SELECT 
   Age,
   COUNT(*) AS Patient_Count
FROM med.hospital
GROUP BY Age
ORDER BY Age;
This will display how many patients are in each age group .

Average BMI for Patients with Obesity:

Calculate the average BMI for a specific subset using the AVG function:
SELECT AVG(BMI) AS Avg_BMI FROM med.hospital WHERE Medical_Condition = 'Obesity';
Filters data specifically for patients with obesity and then averages their BMI .

Important Considerations
Understanding Raw Data: Emphasized the importance of comprehending raw data granularity. Each SQL query or calculation needs to understand the dataset structure, like knowing every row might represent a unique patient【4:5†source】.
Column Order in GROUP BY: Columns specified in GROUP BY ensure that any non-aggregate columns in SELECT are part of the group. Failing to do this often results in SQL errors .
Concepts Reinforced
The use of SQL aggregate functions in extracting meaningful data insights.
Techniques like GROUP BY for aggregating data, which are critically important for organizing systematic data analysis.
