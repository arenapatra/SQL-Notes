Data Retrieval and Sorting

1. Data Retrieval with SQL
Basic Retrieval using SELECT *:


Syntax: SELECT * FROM schema.table_name;

Retrieves all columns and rows from a specified table. Used when exploring data structures for the first time .
Specifying Columns:

It's generally a good practice to specify the columns you need instead of using *, to avoid unnecessary data processing and transfer, which is crucial for performance and maintainability especially in production environments【4:19†typed.md】.

Example:
SELECT product_id, product_name FROM farmers_market.product;


2. Data Ordering with ORDER BY
Sorting Data:
Default sorting order is ascending. You must explicitly specify DESC for descending order.

Example: Sorting products by price in ascending order and by name in descending order:


SELECT * FROM farmers_market.products
ORDER BY price ASC, product_name DESC;

This helps in organizing query results for better readability and analysis


3. Pagination with LIMIT and OFFSET
LIMIT and OFFSET:
LIMIT specifies the number of records to return.
OFFSET skips a specific number of rows before beginning to return rows.
Useful for paginating results in user interfaces or APIs.

Example:
SELECT * FROM farmers_market.customer_purchases
ORDER BY market_date DESC
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5;

Here, it returns 10 records beginning from the 6th record


4. Using JOINs for Combining Tables
Junction Tables:
Used for managing many-to-many relationships by breaking them into many-to-one and one-to-many relationships.
Essential in relational databases for linking related data across tables without redundancy【4:6†transcript.txt】.


5. SQL Functions and Calculations
Inline Calculations:
You can perform operations directly in your SQL query for on-the-fly calculations.

Example: Calculating total costs from quantity and price per item in a purchases table:

SELECT 
  market_date,
  customer_id,
  vendor_id,
  quantity * cost_to_customer_per_qty AS total_cost
FROM farmers_market.customer_purchases;
Inline calculations help with handling computed fields within SELECT statements
