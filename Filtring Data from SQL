Handling NULL Values in SQL
NULL values in SQL represent missing or undefined data. Proper handling of NULLs is critical for ensuring accurate data analysis. Below are key concepts discussed:

NULL vs. Blank: It's vital to differentiate between NULL and a blank string (“”), as both represent different states in databases .

IS NULL and IS NOT NULL: These are used to filter records based on NULL values .

SELECT * FROM farmers_market.product WHERE product_size IS NULL;
IFNULL() Function: This function is used to replace NULL values with a specified default value. This is particularly useful when preparing data for reports or analytics to ensure no gaps exist in data fields .

SELECT product_id, IFNULL(product_size, 'medium') FROM farmers_market.product;
TRIM() Function: Often used to remove spaces from the beginning and end of strings, this function aids in identifying purely blank entries that may just appear as empty strings .

Subqueries
Subqueries, or nested queries, allow you to perform operations in a stepwise manner, first extracting some data and then using that output in another query.

Definition and Use Cases: A subquery is an SQL query nested within another query, allowing for complex filtering and data retrieval operations .

Subqueries are typical in scenarios where data from multiple criteria need to be pulled together, or specific indirect results are required based on another set of data.
Example Usage: Identifying purchases made on rainy days using nested queries:

SELECT * FROM farmers_market.customer_purchases 
WHERE market_date IN 
(SELECT market_date FROM farmers_market.market_date_info WHERE market_rain_flag = 1);
Execution Flow: A subquery (identified as a 'child' query) is executed first to pass its results to its parent query .

Case Statements
Case statements provide a way to implement conditional logic in SQL, allowing the output of the query to vary based on the data.

Definition: A case statement in SQL can evaluate conditions and return a value when the first condition is met (similar to IF-THEN-ELSE logic in programming) .

Use Cases:

Categorizing data based on value ranges.
Deriving new columns based on conditions across multiple fields.
Example:

Creating bins based on purchase amount:
SELECT 
    market_date, 
    customer_id, 
    CASE 
        WHEN quantity * cost_to_customer_per_qty < 5 THEN 'Under $5' 
        WHEN quantity * cost_to_customer_per_qty BETWEEN 5 AND 9.99 THEN '$5 - $9.99' 
        ELSE 'Above $10' 
    END AS price_range 
FROM farmers_market.customer_purchases;
